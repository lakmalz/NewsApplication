# NewsApplication
- This application offers USA(default country) related news as Headlines and Custom news by user selected category(bitcoin, apple, earthquake, animal).
- User can see Headline without registered user. If he wants to see custom news he should be to login on Profile view when using right side tab icon (Profile)
  Then user have to select a keyword what I mentioned category above. And User have to enter email address and tap on Register button there. Then application temporary save user data on shared preferences
  This is a just login. In this purpose. because there wasn't API to save user login/ register service.
